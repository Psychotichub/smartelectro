Build a full-stack AI web application named "SmartElectro AI" for electrical engineers. The app includes the following modules:

1. **Load Forecasting**
   - Use LSTM or Random Forest to predict future power consumption based on timestamped load data.
   - Accept user-uploaded CSV data or simulate load data.
   - Output a line chart showing forecast results.

2. **Fault Detection**
   - Classify faults in single/three-phase systems using current/voltage/time data.
   - Train a model (e.g. Decision Tree or CNN) on labeled fault types: L-G, L-L, L-L-G, 3-Î¦ fault.
   - Allow user to test fault classification with input values.

3. **Cable Calculator**
   - Rule-based or ML-regression model to suggest cable size based on:
     - Voltage (V), Load (kW), Power Factor, Distance (m)
   - Display recommended cable size, voltage drop, and power loss.

4. **Maintenance Alerts**
   - Predict equipment failure based on sensor readings over time (temp, voltage, etc.)
   - Use time-series anomaly detection.

5. **Dashboard**
   - Frontend with React or Next.js or Flutter Web
   - Show real-time simulated data on charts
   - Include login, project creation, and export (PDF/CSV)

6. **Tech Stack**
   - Frontend: React
   - Backend: FastAPI
   - AI: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
   - Database: MongoDB or SQLite

Include:
- Reusable components
- Simple dataset generator for testing
- UI for entering inputs and viewing outputs
- Modular code with clear file structure
